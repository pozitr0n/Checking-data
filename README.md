Checking-data
=============

Verification of input data in older browsers using JavaScript.You need to check the data entered in browsers that don't support HTML5

You can use the JavaScript-library Modernizr, determining the availability of support HTML5-containing attributes and scenarios for alternative solutions when the corresponding functions are not supported.

Save this library in your local folder and declare section head. Just declare the library jQuery, which will facilitate the appeal to 'tvtynfv form and attach an event handler to help.

Then create a script that determines the availability of support required and specifies the pattern and alternative forms handlers, if support is not available.

That's all solution to the problem :).
